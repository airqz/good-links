A website containing valuable links, which people in general should read!

## Getting started

Start with running `npm install`.

To start developing and watch for file changes with `npm run dev`.

__ALL FILES NOT MENTIONED HERE ARE THERE FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES.__ There are still certain links in those files which need to be added to `data.json`.

### Add links

Add new links by adding input to `data.json`. The links will automatically be updated in `index.html`.

### Change layout

If you want to change the layout/HTML of the page, edit `index.mustache` and/or `style.css`.

### Modify interactions

Change `main.js`. Some things are also based on CSS animations, which can be found in `style.css`.
